            <p>Hello friends and <b>Welcome to my Page.</b>
              If you're reading this, you'll probably notice I dislike talking about myself but I hope this breif description will suffice.</p>
              <span id="waves"><img src=""></span>

              <p>Born in Medellin, Colombia and lucky to be raised in a small, private island, right off the East coast called Key Biscayne.
                Raised with Entrepreneural parents, I followed their steps to which led me to study Business Management.<br>
                I quickly learned that even though I love to hustle, sell and start businesses, that career wasn't the path for me.
                From an early age, I was obsessed with trying to become a Hacker. Although I had no coding experience what so ever, I was determined to learn and was fascinated! I dabbled with all the Hats.
                It's safe to say that, without that curiousity, I probably wouldve never jumped into Code.<br>

                <p>A couple of years later, I joined this amazing bootcamp that really expanded my understanding of Code.
                Ironhack was a life changing experience. Within 10 weeks of code being rammed down my noggin, I was able to learn MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular2, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</p>

                <p class="breif">To this day, I'm learning new coding practices, new frameworks and brushing up on my previously learned syntaxs. I hope one day I can land the position I desire in a fun and exciting company!<br></p>

                <p>As for the future, I hope to successfully own multiple tech/development related companies.<br> But, who knows!</p>
