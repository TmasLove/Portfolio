            <p><b>Welcome to my Page.</b>
              If you know me personally, you'll probably know I'm a bit on the shy side but with a little chatter, I'm sure we'll have something in common. Although I dislike talking about myself, I hope this breif 'about me' suffices.</p>
              <span id=""><img src=""></span>

              <p>Born in Medellin, Colombia and lucky to be raised in a small, private island, right off the East coast called Key Biscayne.
                Raised with Entrepreneural parents, I followed their steps to which led me to study Business Management.<br>
                I quickly learned that even though I love to hustle, sell and start businesses, that career wasn't the path for me
                From an early age, I was obsessed with trying to become a some sort of CyberSec graduate. Although I had no experience what so ever, I was determined to learn and was fascinated! I dabbled with all the Hats.
                It's safe to say that, without that curiousity, I probably would've never jumped into Web Developement.<br>

                <p>A couple of years later, I joined this amazing bootcamp that really expanded my understanding of coding.
                Ironhack was a life changing experience. Within 10 weeks of code being rammed down my noggin, I was able to learn the MEAN stack.</p>

                <p class="breif">Ironhack and trying to become a Web developer was an amazing and unforgetable experience. It taught me many things that I'll always use. I have taken a break from coding/Web Developement and joined a wonderful bicycle family, women owned store as a Sales Associate.
                  Yes yes yes, I'm aware at what I said above, but my passion for Cycling has landed me in an amazing position. I'm currently loving what I do, the people that I work with are amazing and so far it's been a great ride. If you are ever in Miami, FL and are interested in a quality experience and purchase,
                  join us at Mack Cycle and Fitness in South Miami :) <br></p>

                <p>As for the future?<br> Who knows!</p>
